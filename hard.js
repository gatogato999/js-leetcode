/*
* Problem Name: Decode Ways II
* Description: A message containing letters from `A-Z` is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping: 'A' -> 1, 'B' -> 2, ..., 'Z' -> 26. To decode an encoded message, all digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (e.g., "11106" can be mapped into: "AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6), "KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)). Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06" cannot be mapped into `F` since "6" is different from "06". In addition to the mapping above, the encoded message may contain the `*` character, which can represent any digit from `1` to `9`. Given a string `s` containing digits and the `*` character, return `the number of ways` to decode it. Since the answer may be very large, return it `modulo` `10^9 + 7`.

* Problem Name: Bag of Tokens
* Description: You have an initial power of `power`, an initial score of `0`, and a bag of `tokens` where `tokens[i]` is the value of the `i`th token (0-indexed). Your goal is to maximize your total score by potentially playing each token in one of two ways: If your current power is at least `tokens[i]`, you may play the `i`th token face up, losing `tokens[i]` power and gaining `1` score.
