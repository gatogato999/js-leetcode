* Description: Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Return the number of unique elements in `nums`.
* Input: A sorted array of integers.
* Output: The number of unique elements, and the modified array.
* Example: nums = [1,1,2] -> 2, nums = [1,2,_]
*/

/*
* Problem Name: Search Insert Position
* Description: Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
* Input: A sorted array of distinct integers and a target value.
* Output: The index of the target or the insertion index.
* Example: [1,3,5,6], 5 -> 2, [1,3,5,6], 2 -> 1
*/

/*
* Problem Name: Length of Last Word
* Description: Given a string `s` consisting of some words separated by some number of spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
* Input: A string s.
* Output: The length of the last word.
* Example: "Hello World" -> 5, "   fly me   to   the moon  " -> 4
*/

/*
* Problem Name: Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String
* Description: Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or -1 if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.
* Input: Two strings, haystack and needle.
* Output: The index of the first occurrence or -1.
* Example: "sadbutsad", "sad" -> 0, "leetcode", "leeto" -> -1
*/

/*
* Problem Name: Two Sum
* Description: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.
* Input: An array of integers and a target integer.
* Output: An array of two indices.
* Example: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 -> [0,1]
*/

/*
* Problem Name: Palindrome Number
* Description: Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.
* Input: An integer x.
* Output: true or false.
* Example: 121 -> true, -121 -> false, 10 -> false
